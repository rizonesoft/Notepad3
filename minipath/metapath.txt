Setting up a Target Application

  To use metapath, you have to setup a target application, which will
  be activated each time you open a file in metapath. Press Ctrl+F12 to
  open the configuration dialog box.

  The best way is to use the "Find Window" button to quickly find a
  target window. metapath will now try and tell this window to open the
  files you choose. This works fine with most programs, especially with
  well-done freeware tools like metapad and many other editors and
  viewers.

  Some applications allow only one instance, so the "Always run target
  application" setting could be another possibility if the procedure
  above doesn't work.

  A minority of applications can only be forced to reuse their windows
  using DDE. The appropriate settings can be found in the "File Types"
  settings of Windows Explorer or directly in the registry (i.e. with
  the "Open in Same Window" DDE strings, it's possible to view all your
  html- and picture-files in the same Internet Explorer window).


Installation and Uninstallation

  Just put a copy of metapath.exe and metapath.ini to any directory on
  your computer. To uninstall metapath, simply delete these two files.
  metapath does not create any registry entries on your computer.

Tips and Tricks, Special Features

  Setting more Options and Custom Filters

  The metapath.ini file contains additional program settings that must
  be modified directly in the ini-file. These settings include custom
  filters for the drop-down menu of the filter dialog and customization
  options for the toolbar bitmaps and labels.


  Run Dialog Box

  The Run Dialog Box has a hidden feature: enter / at the beginning of
  the command line to select the specified file or directory in the
  active metapath window, instead of launching it.


  The "Show - System Objects" Command

  "System Objects" are not only files with the system and/or hidden
  attributes set, but also binary files and device drivers not relevant
  to users, exactly as in Windows Explorer.


  Command Line Parameters

  metapath.exe [file|dir]
               [/n] [/g] [/i]
               [/m [-]FileSpec[;FileSpec2][...]]
               [/p x,y,cx,cy|/ps]
               [/f ini|/f0]

    file|dir: File or directory to open, can be a relative pathname.
    /n: Always open a new metapath window, even if the "reuse-window"
        option is enabled.
    /g: Jump to "Favorites" folder at startup.
    /i: Start as tray icon.
    /m: Specify multiple file filters (separated by ; and optionally
        prefixed by - to indicate negative filters).
    /p: Set window position to x,y and size to cx,cy; /ps use default.
    /f: Specify ini-file; /f0 use no ini-file (don't save settings).


  "Open with..." can copy Files

  If you create a link to a folder and place it in the directory used
  by the "Open with..." dialog, files and directories will be copied to
  that folder when you choose it as the target for the "Open with..."
  operation.
