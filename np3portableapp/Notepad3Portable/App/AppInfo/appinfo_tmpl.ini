[Version]
;PackageVersion is used by the installer and the updater.  It must be in dotted quad X.X.X.X format for use by Windows.  You must ensure that each successive version has a higher package version than the previous or it will not be treated as a newer version by the platform's updater. Generally, the PackageVersion is based on the DisplayVersion.  So an app with version 3.4 will have a package version of 3.4.0.0.
PackageVersion=2.0.2.436
;DisplayVersion is displayed to the user and used in naming the installer
DisplayVersion=2.0.2.0
;Some example Display and Package versions
;3.4 would be 3.4.0.0
;4.5a would be 4.5.1.0
;1.2 Dev Test 1 would be 1.1.99.1  Why?  So we can have room to grow and still use 1.2.0.0 as the official stable release. Dev tests with 3 and 4 digit numbers can be indicated similarly. 4.5.1 Dev Test 1 would be 4.4.1.991 and 4.5.1.1 Dev Test 1 would be 4.5.0.991.
