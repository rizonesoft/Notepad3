=====================================================
Version 2 Build 505 (23 September 2017)
=====================================================
- 1st chunk of StrSafe migration.
- Some more StrSafe changes
- Fix: manually edited settings (SciDirectWriteTech, SciFontQuality) 
    should be placed in settings section [Settings2].
- Extended default "space char set" for "Accelerated Word Navigation" to avoid 
    unexpected "accelerated word navigation" behavior, space-char extension is 
    restricted to 7-bit ASCII char set (ignoring specified non-7-bit-ASCII chars).
- StrSafe adaptions
- Fixed: settings SciFontQuality have been overwritten by Scheme configuration.
    (Fonts: Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Consolas, Constantia, Corbel, Segoe UI are using 
    'cleartype smoothing' (SC_EFF_QUALITY_LCD_OPTIMIZED) by default, if not 
    configured in Schema definition for Lexer)
- Added font "Source Code Pro" to list of special fonts for cleartype smoothing.
- Fix: undo destructive operation on selection (rectangle) does not restore 
    selection or preserves selection mode (extends selection on caret movement)
    -> need to send SCI_CANCEL at the end of restored selection.
- Found bug caused by StrSafe migration 
    (COUNTOF() for buffer size must not be used on buffer pointer)
- migrate StrCpyN() and StrCatBuff() to corresponding StrSafe.h methods
- Adapted lstrcpyn() calls according to StrSafe.h requirements.
- Refactoring of "Accelerated Word Navigation" to be compliant with Scintillas 
    WhiteSpace and Punctuation defines.
- "Accelerated Word Navigation" activation influences "Mark Occurrences" (whole word) if set
- Extended: Remember selection undo / redo
- Added undo / redo selection to more operations
- Found Scintilla 400 method "SCI_CUT" (cut selection) broken: lost last char
    replaced by SCI_COPY & SCI_CLEAR combination (for now).
- changes to EditGetClipboardText() solved the SCI_CUT problem, so it can be switched back 
    from SCI_COPY & SCI_CLEAR to SCI_CUT (byte alignment in 64-bit, i am nut sure)
- switching Scintilla internal codepage to UTF-8 only (resp. Japanese, 
    Chinese and Korean DBCS) single-byte encoding is supported externally and 
    converted (fore and back) to UTF-8 internally, this simplifies i.e. clipboard exchange, etc.
- Removed support for obsolete Korean Johab (1361) codepage.
- Fixed ConvertText() according to internal SCI codepage
- Refactoring: Encoding handling
- More operations for selections undo/redo.
- Enabled "unlimited" (as in Scintilla Lib: dep. on memory and INT_MAX) 
    undo / redo selection history using utarray from uthash header library 
    (https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/index.html)
- Moved crypto readme to doc dir
- remove internal codepage support for Chinese, Japan, Korean DBCS use 
    generalized UTF-8 codepage instead 
    (conversions do not work as expected within scintilla lib)
- Dropping Windows XP support , using compiler toolset vc141 Win SDK 10.0. 
    (current VC++ redistributable needed?)
- Replaced lstrcmp() and lstrcmpi() by StrSafe (helper.h defined) methods.
- Relaunch elevated keeping current changes in a buffer.
- Fixed some problems for feature "relaunch elevated preserve changes".
- First AppVeyor config
- Remember window position in case of "relaunch elevated".
- Fixed memory initialization problem during InitInstance()
- Enhanced consistency between toolbar (save button) and titlebar (modified marker)
- "Relaunch elevated": use current .ini-file instead of new user's (Admin's) .ini
- Cleanup tmp filebuffer, if elevation has been rejected.
- Fixed crash in case of wrong Encoding (detection)
- Changed version display on Help/About.
- New Powershell script to patch version numbers
- appveyor.yml using same powershell commands to patch version
- Remove FindReplaceDlg handle declared as external from compilation unit Edit.c not really needed here.
    (externals (handles / pointers) seemed to be a problem on module init instance time in 64-bit)
- Fixed: Open find dialog the first time (new NP3 instance) while
    clipboard is empty, NP3 crashes (try to LocalFree() static allocated memory)
- Fixed: RegExpr "Find previous" corrected (find mode "left to right" has been 
    used, which has not the intended behavior).
- Updated Compiler Info.
- Added build.txt (and .ps1 changes) for Local Build Version patching 
    (common AppVeyor/Local script).
- Fixed issue "Convert to Title Case" while selected text is all upper case.
- Fixed broken "Complete Word" feature (Ctrl+Enter/Return).
- Changed accelerator key for feature "Complete Word" from Ctrl+Enter to Ctrl+Alt+Enter.
- Added feature "Insert New (empty) Line above current line Ctrl+Enter (as in VisualStudio).
- Code cleanup
- Added new Settings "Virtual Space on Rectangular Selection" used to select. 
    rectangle not delimited by line endings (but including virtual space).
