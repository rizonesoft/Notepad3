  Introduction
  
  Regular expression is to express a characteristic in a string, and then to match another string
  with the characteristic. For example, pattern "ab+" means "one 'a' and at least one 'b' ", so "ab",
  "abb", "abbbbbbb" match the pattern.
  
  Regular expression is used to : (1) test a string whether it matches a pattern, such as a email
  address. (2) to find a substring which matches certain pattern, from a whole text. (3) to do
  complex replacement in a text.
  
  It is very simple to study regular expression syntax, and the few abstract concepts can be
  understood easily too. Many articles does not introduce its concepts from simple ones to
  abstract ones step by step, so some persons may feel it is difficult to study. On the other hand,
  each regular expression engine's document will describe its special function, but this part of
  special function is not what we should study first.

  
  1. Regular Expression Basic Syntax
  
  1.1 Common Characters
  
  Letters, numbers, the underline, and punctuations with no special definition are "common
  characters". When regular expression matches a string, a common character can match the
  same character.
  
  - Example1: When pattern "c" matches string "abcde", match result: success; substring
  matched: "c"; position: starts at 2, ends at 3.

  - Example2: When pattern "bcd" matches string "abcde",match result: success; substring
  matched: "bcd"; position: starts at 1, ends at 4.


  1.2 Simple escaped characters

  Nonprinting characters which we know:

  Expression  Matches
  \r, \n      Carriage return, newline character
  \t          Tabs
  \\          Matches "\" itself

  Some punctuations are specially defined in regular expression. To match these characters in
  string, add "\" in pattern. For example: ^, $ has special definition, so we need to use "\^" and
  "\$" to match them.


  Expression  Matches
  \^         Matches "^" itself
  \$         Matches "$" itself

  \.         Matches dot(.) itself

  These escaped characters have the same effect as "common characters": to match a certain
  character.


 - Example1: When pattern "\$d" matches string "abc$de", match result: success; substring
  matched: "$d"; position: starts at 3, ends at 5.


  1.3 Expression matches anyone of many characters

  Some expressions can match anyone of many characters. For example: "\d" can match any
  number character. Each of these expressions can match only one character at one time, though
  they can match any character of a certain group of characters.

  Expression  Matches

  \d         Any digit character, any one of 0~9
  \w         Any alpha, numeric, underline, any one of A~Z,a~z,0~9,_
  \s         Any one of space, tab, newline, return, or newpage character

  .          '.' matches any character except the newline character(\n)

 - Example1: When pattern "\d\d" matches "abc123", match result: success; substring
  matched: "12"; position: starts at 3, ends at 5.

 - Example2: When pattern "a.\d" matches "aaa100", match result: success; substring
  matched: "aa1"; position: starts at 1, ends at 4.


  1.4 Custom expression matches anyone of many characters

  Expression uses square brackets [ ] to contain a series of characters, it can match anyone of
  them. Uses [^ ] to contain a series of characters, it can match anyone character except
  characters contained.

  Expression   Matches

  [ab5@]       Matches "a" or "b" or "5" or "@"
  [^abc]       Matches any character except "a","b","c"

  [f-k]        Any character among "f"~"k"
  [^A-F0-3]    Any character except "A"~"F","0"~"3"

 - Example1: When pattern "[bcd][bcd]" matches "abc123" , match result: success; substring
  matched: "bc"; position: starts at 1, ends at 3.

 - Example2: When pattern "[^abc]" matches "abc123", match result: success; substring
  matched: "1"; position: starts at 3, ends at 4.


  1.5 Special expression to quantify matching

  All expressions introduced before can match character only one time. If a expression is
  followed by a quantifier, it can matches more than one times.


  For example: we can use the pattern "[bcd]{2}" instead of "[bcd][bcd]".

  Expression  Function
             Match exactly n times, example:   "\w{2}" equals "\w\w";    "a{5}"
  {n}
             equals "aaaaa"
  {m,n}      At least m but no more than n times:    "ba{1,3}" matches "ba","baa","baaa"

  {m,}       Match at least n times:    "\w\d{2,}" matches "a12","_456","M12344"...
  ?          Match 1 or 0 times, equivalent to {0,1}:    "a[cd]?" matches "a","ac","ad".

  +          Match 1 or more times, equivalent to {1,}:    "a+b" matches "ab","aab","aaab"...
  *          Match 0 or more times, equivalent to {0,}:    "\^*b" matches "b","^^^b"...


 - Example1: When pattern "\d+\.?\d*" matches "It costs $12.5", match result: success;
  substring matched:"12.5"; position: starts at 10, ends at 14.


 - Example2: When pattern "go{2,8}gle" matches "Ads by goooooogle", match result:
  success; substring matched: "goooooogle"; position: starts at 7, ends at 17.



  1.6 Some special punctuations with abstract function

  Some punctuations in pattern have special function:

  Expression  Function
  ^          Match the beginning of the string
  $          Match the end of the string

  \b         Match a word boundary

  More examples to help you to understand.

 - Example1: When pattern "^aaa" matches "xxx aaa xxx", match result: failed. Because "^"
  must match the beginning of the string. It could match successfully on condition that "aaa" is
  at the beginning of the string, such as "aaa xxx xxx".

 - Example2: When pattern "aaa$" matches "xxx aaa xxx", match result: failed. Bacause "$"
  must match the end of the string. It could match successfully on condition that "aaa" is at the
  end of the string,    such as "xxx xxx aaa".

 - Example3: When pattern ".\b." matches "@@@abc", match result: success; substring
  matched: "@a"; position: starts at 2, ends at 4.
  Further explanation: "\b" is similar to "^" and "$", matches no character itself, but it require a
  '\w' character at its one side, another not '\w' character at the other side.


 - Example4: When pattern "\bend\b" matches "weekend,endfor,end", match result:
  success; substring matched: "end"; position: starts at 15, ends at 18.

  Some special punctuation can make effect on other sub-patterns:


  Expression Function
  |          Alternation, matches either left side or right side
             (1). Let sub-patterns in it to be a whole part when it is quantified.
  ( )
             (2). Match result of sub-patterns in it can be retrieved individually

 - Example5: When pattern "Tom|Jack" matches string "I'm Tom, he is Jack", match result:
  success; substring matched: "Tom"; position: starts at 4, ends at 7. When match next, match
  result: success; substring matched: "Jack"; position: starts at 15, ends at 19.


 - Example6: When pattern "(go\s*)+" matches "Let's go go go!", match result: success;
  substring matched: "go go go"; position: starts at 6, ends at 14.

 - Example7: When pattern "?(\d+\.?\d*)" matches "$10.9,?20.5", match result: success;
  substring matched: "?20.5"; position: starts at 6, ends at 10. Match result of sub-patterns 
  in "( )" is: "20.5".


  2. Regular expression advanced syntax

  2.1 Reluctant or greedy quantifiers

  There are serval method to quantify subpattern, such as: "{m,n}", "{m,}", "?", "*", "+". By
  default, a quantified subpattern is "greedy", that is, it will match as many times as possible
  (given a particular starting location) while still allowing the rest of the pattern to match. For
  example, to match "dxxxdxxxd":

  Expression     Match result

      (d)(\w+)   "\w+" matches all characters "xxxdxxxd" behind of "d"
                 "\w+" matches all characters "xxxdxxx" between the first "d" and the last
      (d)(\w+)(d)  "d". In order to let the whole pattern match success, "\w" has to give up the
                 last "d", although it can match the last "d" too.

  Thus it can be seen that: when "\w+" matches, it will match as many characters as possible.
  In the second example, it does not match the last "d", but this is in order to let the whole
  pattern match successfully. Pattern with "*" or "{m,n}" will also match as many times as
  possible, pattern with "?" will match if possible. This type of matching is called "greedy
  matching". ?


  Reluctant Matching:

  To follow the quantifier with a "?", it can let the pattern to match the minimum number of
  times possible. This type of matching is called reluctant matching. In order to let the whole
  pattern match successfully, the reluctant pattern may match a few more times if it is required.
  For example, to match "dxxxdxxxd":

  Expression     Match result

      (d)(\w+?)  "\w+?" match as few times as possible, so "\w+?" matches only one "x"
                 In order to let the whole pattern match successfully, "\w+?" has to match
      (d)(\w+?)(d)
                 "xxx". So, match result is: "\w+?" matches "xxx"

  More examples:

 - Example1: When pattern "<td>(.*)</td>" matches "<td><p>aa</p></td>
  <td><p>bb</p></td>", match result: success; substring matched: the whole
  "<td><p>aa</p></td> <td><p>bb</p></td>", "</td>" in the pattern matches the last
  "</td>" in the string.

 - Example2: For comparison, when pattern "<td>(.*?)</td>" matches the string in
  example1, it matches "<td><p>aa</p></td>". When match next, the next "<td><p>bb</p>
  </td>" can be matched.


  2.2 Referring to matched substring \1, \2...

  During the process of matching, the match results of subpattern between parentheses "( )"
  are recorded for later use. When retrieving match results, those match result of subpattern can
  be retrieved individually, and this has been demonstrated many times in former examples. In
  practice, parentheses "( )" must be used to get what we want indeed after match, such as
  "<td>(.*?)</td>".


  In fact, those match result of subpattern between parentheses can be used not only after
  matching, but also during matching. The latter part of subpattern, can refer the match result of
  former subpattern. Usage: "\" plus a number to refer to the corresponding substring. "\1" refers
  to 1st pair of parentheses' match result, "\2" refers to 2nd pair of parentheses' match result.

  Examples:

 - Example1: When pattern "('|")(.*?)(\1)" matches " 'Hello', "World" ", match result: success;
  substring matched: " 'Hello' "; when match next, substring matched: " "World" ".

 - Example2: When pattern "(\w)\1{4,}" matches "aa bbbb abcdefg ccccc 111121111
  999999999", match result: success; substring matched: "ccccc"; when match next, substring
  matched "999999999". This pattern require a character of "\w" to repeat at least 5 times.
  Pay attention to comparison with "\w{5,}".

 - Example3: When pattern "<(\w+)\s*(\w+(=('|").*?\4)?\s*)*>.*?</\1>" matches "<td
  id='td1' style="bgcolor:white"></td>", match result: success. If both "<td>" and "</td>" are
  not "td", the match will fail.


  2.2b DEELX Regular Expression Replace Syntax
  
  $1 ~ $999 - Stands for what a certain group captured. If the number is larger than the max group number, 
  DEELX will use less digitals, till the number is smaller than or equal to the max group number.
    For example:
      If the max group number is 20, "$999" means "$9" and common string "99", while "$15" means the 15th group.
      If you need "$1" and common string "5", you can use $0015 , DEELX at most recognize 3 digitals as number.

   ${name} - Stands for what a named group captured.
   $$      - Stands for a single dollars ($).
   $&      - Stands for what the overall expression captured.
   $`      - The substring before the beginning of what the overall expression captured in the original text.
   $'      - The substring behind the end of what the overall expression captured in the original text.
   $+      - Stands for what a group captured, which group has the max group number among those groups 
             that have captured. For example: when "aaa(b+)|ccc(b+)" matches "aaabbb" , 
             $+ stands for $1, even though $2 has the max group number.
   $_      - Stands for the whole original text.


  2.3 Lookahead assertion; Lookbehind assertion
  In former chapters, I have introduced serval punctuations with special function:
  "^","$","\b". They all do not match any characters, but they all require certain conditions on
  their position. Now, this chapter will introduce more methods to add conditions on the gap
  between characters.

  Lookahead assertion: "(?=xxxxx)", "(?!xxxxx)"

  Format: "(?=xxxxx)", the condition which it add on the gap is that: string on the right side of
  the gap must be abe to match the subpattern "xxxxx" between the parentheses. It is just a
  condition, not a match operation, so there is no match result.

 - Example1: When pattern "Windows (?=NT|XP)" matches "Windows 98, Windows NT,
  Windows 2000", it can match only "Windows " of "Windows NT", the other "Windows " could
  not be matched.

 - Example2: When pattern "(\w)((?=\1\1\1)(\1))+" matches "aaa ffffff 999999999", it can
  match first 4 "f"s among the 6 "f"s, it can match first 7 "9"s among 9 "9"s.

  Format: "(?!xxxxx)", string on the right side of the gap must not be able to match the
  subpattern "xxxxx".

 - Example3: When pattern "((?!\bstop\b).)+" matches "fdjka ljfdl stop fjdsla fdj", it will
  match from the beginning of string to the position of "stop". If there is no "stop" in the string,
  the pattern will match the whole string.


 - Example4: When pattern "do(?!\w)" matches "done, do, dog", it can only match "do".
  Here, "(?!\w)" has the same effect as "\b".

  Lookbehind assertion: "(?<=xxxxx)", "(?<!xxxxx)"


  The concepts of "Lookbehind assertion" and "Lookahead assertion" are similar. "(?<=xxxxx)"
  and "(?<!xxxxx)" require the string on the left side of the gap to be able to match or to be not
  able to match the subpattern, not the right side. And they will not match any characters
  themselves too.

  Example5: When pattern "(?<=\d{4})\d+(?=\d{4})" matches "1234567890123456", it will
  match 8 numbers in the middle, except first 4 numbers and last 4 numbers. Because
  lookbehind assertion is not supported by JScript.RegExp, this example could not be
  demonstrated. There are many engines support lookbehind assertion, such as java.util.regex
  package in Java 1.4 or later, System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace in .NET platform, and
  DEELX Regexp Engine etc.


  3. Other usually supported rules


  There are several usually supported rules which have not been mentioned.

  3.1 In pattern, a character can be expressed as "\xXX" or "\uXXXX" ("X" is a hex number)


  Format     Character range
  \xXX       0 ~ 255, such as    space can be "\x20"

  \uXXXX     Any character can be expressed as "\u" plus 4 hex numbers, such as    "\u4E2D"

  3.2 While "\s", "\d", "\w", "\b" are specially defined, their uppercase letters have the opposite
  meaning


  Pattern  Matches
  \S           All characters except spaces
  \D           All characters except numeric characters

  \W           All characters except alpha, numeric, "_"

  \B           Characters' gap which is not a word boundary

  3.3 Specially defined characters table

  Character Description
  ^        Matches the beginning of the string. Use "\^" to match "^" itself

  $        Matches the end of the string. Use "\$" to match "$" itself
  ( )      Grouping. Use "\(" and "\)" to match "(" and ")"
  [ ]      Character class. Use "\[" and "\]" to match "[" and "]"

  { }      Define quantifiers. Use "\{" and "\}" to match "{" and "}"
  .        Match any character except newline(\n). Use "\." to match "." itself
  ?        Let subpattern match 0 or 1 time. Use "\?" to match "?" itself
  +        Let subpattern match at least 1 times. Use "\+" to match "+" itself
  *        Let subpattern match any times. Use "\*" to match "*" itself

  |        Alternation. Use "\|" to match "|" itself

  3.4 If a subpattern is in "(?:xxxxx)", the match result is not recorded for later use.

 - Example1: When pattern "(?:(\w)\1)+" matches "a bbccdd efg", the substring matched:
  "bbccdd". The match result of subpattern in "(?:)" is not recorded, so "\1" is used to refer to the
  match result of "(\w)".

  3.5 Pattern attribute: Ignorecase,Singleline,Multiline,Global

  Attribute    Description

  Ignorecase   Do case-insensitive pattern matching. Default is case-sensitive.
               Treat string as single line. That is, change "." to match any character
  Singleline
               whatsoever, even a newline, which it normally would not match.
               Treat string as multiple lines. Default is that "^" and "$" match at only the very
               start? of the string and end? of the string. If multiline, they match the
               start? of any line and end? of any line within the string:
  Multiline

               ?xxxxxxxxx?\n
               ?xxxxxxxxx?

  Global       Replace all matches if the pattern is used in replace operation.



  4. Integrated prompt


  4.1 If you want to know what else are implemented by advanced engines, you can refer to
  DEELX Syntax on this site.

  4.2 If the pattern is required to match the whole string, not a part of string, we may use "^" and
  "$", such as: "^\d+$" require the whole string consist of digit characters.

  4.3 If the pattern is required to match a whole word, not a part of word, we may use "\b" at the
  beginning and the end of the pattern, such as:    use "\b(if|while|else|void|int……)\b" to match
  keywords in a program.

  4.4 Do not let pattern match empty string "". Or you will get an empty substring matched,
  while the match operation returns success. For example: if we need a pattern to match
  "123"?"123."?"123.5"?".5", we should not use this pattern "\d*\.?\d*". Though there is
  nothing, we may still get a success.   Proper pattern: "\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+".

  4.5 Do not let a subpattern loop infinite times if the subpattern can match empty string.

  4.6 Choose reluctant or greedy quantifier properly.
  4.7 Only one side of "|" to match a certain character.
