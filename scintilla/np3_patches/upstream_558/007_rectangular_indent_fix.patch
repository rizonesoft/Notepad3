# Rectangular Selection Indent Fix (5.5.8)
# TYPE: Code patch (applied)
# 
# ORIGINAL ANALYSIS: The NP3 upgrade_024 patch appeared to intentionally remove
# this fix. However, investigation revealed this was because the patch was
# created to bring NP3 customizations FROM 5.5.7 baseline, and the removal
# was inadvertent - the author wasn't aware this fix should be preserved.
#
# THE FIX: Temporarily treats rectangular selection as stream selection during
# indent operations to avoid problems with recalculating rectangular range
# multiple times.
#
# CHANGE:
# - At start of Indent(): Save selType, convert rectangular to stream
# - At end of Indent(): Restore selType, call ThinRectangularRange()
#
# FILE: scintilla/src/Editor.cxx (Indent function)
#
# STATUS: ✅ APPLIED
#
# NOTE: The NP3 upgrade_024 patch should be updated to NOT remove this fix
# in future upgrades.
