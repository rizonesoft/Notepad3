# Selection Serialization Format Change (5.5.8)
# TYPE: Full file replacement (applied)
# 
# REASON FOR CHANGE: 
# Although NP3 does not currently use SCI_GETSELECTIONSERIALIZED or 
# SCI_SETSELECTIONSERIALIZED, applying this patch future-proofs the codebase.
#
# CHANGES IN 5.5.8:
# - Selection.cxx: Refactored string parsing for serialized selections
# - Selection.h: Signature changes for constructors (string_view -> string_view&)
# - Format change: Main index now appears at START with '#' prefix
#   Old format: "1-0,2-3#1" (main index at end)
#   New format: "#1,1-0,2-3" (main index at start)
#
# FILES REPLACED:
# - scintilla/src/Selection.cxx
# - scintilla/src/Selection.h
#
# NP3 CONFLICT: NONE - These files have no NP3 modifications
#
# STATUS: ✅ APPLIED
